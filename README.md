## About Me

I am an undergraduate student majoring in *Applied Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence* at Sapienza University of Rome.  
My interests focus on **machine learning, computer vision, and cybersecurity**.  
I aim to bridge AI technologies with information security through both academic research and practical projects.

Currently, I am building experience through:

- **Python & AI Development** – Data analysis, ML models, and text recognition  
- **Web Development** – Front-end (Vue.js / React Native) and back-end (Go / REST API)  
- **Cybersecurity Fundamentals** – TryHackMe & HackTheBox learning paths  
- **Open Source & Collaboration** – Publishing academic and course-based projects on GitHub
