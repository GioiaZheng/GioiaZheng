## About Me

I am an undergraduate student in *Applied Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence* at Sapienza University of Rome.  
My main interests lie in **machine learning**, **computer vision**, and **cybersecurity**.  
I aim to bridge AI technologies with information security through both academic research and practical development.

Currently, I am gaining experience in:

- **Python and AI development** – data analysis, ML model implementation, and text recognition  
- **Web development** – front-end (Vue.js / React Native) and back-end (Go / REST APIs)  
- **Cybersecurity fundamentals** – TryHackMe and HackTheBox learning paths  
- **Open source collaboration** – publishing academic and course-based projects on GitHub

## Academic Projects

### WASA_proj (Go, Vue.js, Docker)
A full-stack chat web application developed for the *Web and Software Architecture* course.  
Focuses on API design, containerization, and client-server communication.  
(Currently private until final evaluation)

### CiboCompass (React Native, HCI)
Developed as part of the *Human–Computer Interaction* course.  
A cross-platform mobile app built with Expo Go, focusing on usability testing, interaction design, and cultural food discovery.

### Handwritten Text Recognizer (Python, PyTorch)
Course-related OCR project combining deep learning and computer vision.  
I contributed to model testing, evaluation, and performance visualization.
